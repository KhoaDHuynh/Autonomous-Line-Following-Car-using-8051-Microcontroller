# Autonomous-Line-Following Car using 8051 Microcontroller

Designed and implemented a line-following robot car using the 8051 microcontroller. The system integrates IR sensors (TCRT5000), ADC modules, LCD display, and DC motor control via PWM. Developed control algorithms and interrupt-based firmware in assembly to detect path deviation and adjust direction accordingly.

Features include dynamic speed control via external interrupts, real-time LCD display of speed and direction, and an H-bridge motor driver for bidirectional movement.
